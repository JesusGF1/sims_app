# Codespaces Folder

This folder contains:

- A bash script for setting up the SIMS virtual environment.
- A Jupyter Notebook to be used in GitHub Codespaces for running SIMS.

You should drag and drop your `.h5ad` file(s) here so they can be used for training and inference in the Jupyter Notebook.
